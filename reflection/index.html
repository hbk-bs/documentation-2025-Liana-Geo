        Throughout this semester, I often began with ambitious ideas and ended up refining them into more achievable forms. The process consistently reminded me of the importance of adaptability: not every concept works as imagined, but with adjustments, I have been able to complete projects that I can show with confidence. </p> <p>
Working with AI tools has enabled me to create projects I could not have created myself otherwise. They challenged me to think differently about how to approach creative work and encouraged me to experiment more freely with ideas. I learned how important clear instructions are when working with AI, and how unexpected results can sometimes open up new directions I had not considered before. </p> <p>
The techniques that stuck with me most were sketching ideas quickly, “vibe coding”, as well as learning to break down a large concept into smaller, workable steps. What surprised me most was how easy coding can actually be with the help of the input of an AI. Coding does not feel like a concept that is out of my grasp anymore, but instead like something easily accessible. If it should be that easily accessible is a different question though - I am still concerned about the ecological impact the usage of AI will have. </p> <p>
All in all, I am very grateful for what I have learned in this class. Although I still lack quite a bit of technical knowledge, I feel more secure in my ability to take on projects, even if I do not completely understand them at the start - the understanding comes along the way, through working, experimenting, and adapting during the process. Moving forward, I am curious about what possibilities will open up to me in the future with the knowledge I have gained through this course, and what ideas I can follow with it.
