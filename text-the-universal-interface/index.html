      <p>
       Our task was to use the Val Town LLM and AI tools to create a project, but it should not just be a chat bot. </p>
<p>
My first concept was to make an interactive story set inside the HBK, where you could control the events of the story by pressing certain colors that would trigger specific events to happen. The colors were based on associations with the color, for example, if you pressed red, something dangerous would happen and if you pressed blue, something sad would happen.
</p><p>
Ultimately I scrapped that idea because it was too complicated. I knew I wanted to stick with something text-based, so I ended up with the idea of a poem generator. The way it works is that I input a prompt into the LLM and based on that it generates text. </p> <p>
My prompt was: ‚ÄúYou are a poetic assistant. Write a single poetic verse in response to each prompt.  Do not include the prompt in the response. Use json. The verses should relate to each other, but dont repeat verses. Dont use commas or periods at the end of a verse.‚Äù
 The words are based on common themes in poems.
</p>
<p>
I found it surprisingly easy to work with the LLM, as the heavy lifting of the work is done by it and all I had to do was write a concrete prompt and do the styling. I definitely wish I could have gone with a more creative Idea, as there are so many interesting things one could do with a large language model, but all in all, I am pretty satisfied with my result.</p>
