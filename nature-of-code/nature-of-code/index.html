Our course went on an excursion to the island Amrum, where we spent our time watching and taking notes on the natural systems of the island. <p></p>

<p>I found interest in the patterns in the sand after it dried. The patterns are caused by the motion of the waves. I did traditional sketches of it to get a feeling of how it worked and then tried my best to describe the motion to an AI so it could help me with the creation of the code. But merely based on my description I did not get the results I hoped for, so eventually I submitted one of my sketches to an AI and then it got closer to repeating the patterns of the sand. In one of my first codes, there was a simulated wave that would cause the patterns, but I scrapped the idea and decided to focus on the patterns instead of the wave that causes them.
</p>
<p>The result is an animated line that moves from the left side of the page down and then up again, picking up the patterns from the previous lines. The lines do not touch each other. In retrospect I see that the pattern more resembles the bark of a tree instead of the patterns in the sand. Nonetheless, I am quite happy with the effect of the result, even if it does not resemble the original natural system that much.
