       Our task was to work in groups to create a graphic novel with AI. My group consisted of Margarethe Sch√§fer, Sarah Lutterloh, Ylva Fee Beischall and me. Our graphic novel is titled ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWas los?‚Äù in german.
</p><p>
We started the project by brainstorming our ideas for a story. We settled on the narrative being about a man who feels that something is wrong with him, and in the story he figures out what it is - at first we could not decide between making him be an alien or having him have a crisis about being a string of code. Ultimately, we went with the idea of the protagonist discovering that he is an alien and coming to peace with it. 
<p>
We wrote the story into bullet points and then made a hand-drawn storyboard to decide how many frames we need and what we want depicted in each frame.
</p><p>
Then came the difficult part; the generating of the images. We used midjourney to create our images. It was a bit complicated to get the person in the images to have a consistent look to them and to also have the art style be consistent. Though creating the website proved to be easier. We decided on a simple layout where the text accompanying the story is displayed under the images with the pages number under it where you can simply click through them. 
</p>
<p>
All in all, I found generating the images the most difficult part, due to how inconsistent the results could be in quality. Nonetheless, I found it to be a fun exercise for storytelling and working on creative projects as a team.
