        In my Teachable Machine Project, you squish a hamster with your hands. 

“Squish The Hamster” consists of 4 images of a cute hamster that will show up based on what motion you do with your hands. Your motion is being captured by your camera. If you do nothing, the hamster looks at you expectantly. If you raise your hand, it is happy and a hand appears petting it. If you make a squishing motion, the hamster is being squished. If you show both hands to the camera, two hands wring the hamster. <p></p>

<p>The idea is pretty absurd but it was great fun to play with such an idea using the teachable machine model. My code was done mostly with the help of Chat GPT, the drawings were made by me. The way the code works is that when a specific category is triggered by the camera input, for example the “soft squish”, the image of the hamster being softly squished shows up. </p>

<p>It took some time until I settled on this idea. My first project idea was actually a game where you draw some outlines and the teachable machine model guesses what country outline it is. Unfortunately, that was pretty hard to pull off and it would just guess “Albania” for every outline. The teachable machine model also does not quite work like that - since it bases the category mostly on the colors shown, and not the shapes or motions, of course any black outline on any white underground will appear the same way to the model. So after some brain storming, I settled on the idea of “Squish The Hamster”, inspired by my project from last semester “Pet The Cat”, where you could pet a cat by clicking on it.
