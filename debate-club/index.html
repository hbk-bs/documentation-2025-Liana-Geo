For our Debate Club, I was in the group against AI. </p><p>

During the discussion, I have learned that there are very helpful things that AI can be used for - for example in medical settings, where it can be used to narrow down a diagnosis quicker, or for scientific research. But since we are art and design students, we did not have a lot of focus on that. </p> <p>

If AI can be helpful for art and design is a different question. Since AI art works based on pre-existing art, it gets complicated when you think about copyright and an artist's right to their own art. There have been plenty of artists whose art styles have been used to train AI without their consent, which has impacted the artists badly, as instead of being commissioned, people will just use an AI instead. We talked a lot about a brand that had an entire AI generated commercial, and while there have been great points made in support of it - such as it being more low-effort and quicker for the brand, and the brand having to spend less money on actors - I can't help but think of something heavily using AI for visual imagery as just looking low-quality and heartless. </p><p>


Though the debate has presented me with plenty of different viewpoints, my opinion on AI has not changed that much. I do admit it is very convenient to use and I have been using it with satisfying results - but at what cost? How many litres of water have been used to make the code I'm using? What will be the ecological consequences? Am I taking part in the normalization of a tool that might prove to do more harm than good? Why does everyone have access to a tool that can do so much harm? I believe there need to be more regulations put into place so that the harm can be controlled and kept in bounds. </p><p>

The image shows my notes I took during the debate.
